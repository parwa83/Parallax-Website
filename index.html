        <h1>Early Life</h1>
        <p>
            Mahendra Singh Dhoni was born on July 7, 1981, in Ranchi, Bihar (now in Jharkhand), India. He comes from a middle-class Rajput family. His father, Pan Singh, worked in a junior management position at MECON, and his mother, Devaki Devi, was a homemaker.

            Originally interested in football and badminton, Dhoni was a goalkeeper for his school football team. His sports teacher recognized his reflexes and encouraged him to try cricket as a wicketkeeper. He joined the Commando Cricket Club and later played for Central Coal Fields Limited (CCL).

            Despite a modest background, Dhoni balanced studies, a job as a TTE (ticket examiner) at Kharagpur railway station, and cricket before his breakthrough in Indian domestic and international cricket.
